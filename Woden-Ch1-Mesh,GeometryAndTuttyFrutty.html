      <h1>I. Introduction to Shader Language</h1>
<p>The goal of this chapter is to explain the basics of OpenGL graphics primitives, geometry and Basic structure.</p>

<h1>II. Graphics Primitives</h1><p>By default OpenGL renders object in combinaison of point, lines (understanding <em>line segments</em>) or triangles.
Points  are single vertex (a three-dimensional points in space). OpenGL provide some function to set the pixel value of a point, it is important to notice that each pixel of the point will be pass throught the fragment shader (so a point can have multiple color dependinhg how many pixel is allocated to it).

A lines is a segments between two vertexs. OpenGL provide 3 way to declare lines as Presented in the folowing picture.</p><ol><li> In GL_LINES mode line are independant and you explicitly need two points to draw a line.</li><li> In GL_LINE_STRIP a line is formed by two points using the previous point as origin.</li><li> In GL_LINE_LOOP a line is formed by two points using the previous point as origin and the really first point is connected to the last one.</li></ol><p><figure><img src="Images/GL_LINES.png"></img><figcaption>GL_LINES</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The triangle primitive is far-away the most used. Everything can be redraw using triangle that why triangle is most optimized and recomended to used.</p>
<ol><li> In GL_TRIANGLES mode triangle are independant and you explicitly need three points to draw a triangles.</li><li> In GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP a new triangle is formed by each additional vertex using the two previous one.</li><li> In GL_TRIANGLE_FAN a new triangle is formed by each additional vertex using the origin and the previous one.</li></ol><p><figure><img src="Images/GL_TRIANGLES.png"></img><figcaption>GL_TRIANGLES</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>it exist some other mode like GL_QUAD, GL_QUAD_STRIP and GL_POLYGON but there are deprecated and non optimal. As we can represente all of them by simple triangle it is recomended to simply used triangle.
